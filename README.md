# sage-2.1.0-opc3

This directory contains materials and scripts used to carry out a re-fit of Sage 2.1.0 with OPC3 water.

**Note: since this fit was started, we have uncovered several issues with Evaluator. One was fixed in 0.4.10 (https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-evaluator/issues/575); we're still troubleshooting the other. We would recommend *not* using the environment in this repo to run further fits until everything is fixed.**
